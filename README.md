# QuoteBot
litteraly quotes discord messages
use ?quote #channel (param)

(param) can either be a number, that is a message ID (as obtained from right-click, Copy ID). Or it can be a substring of the message you want to record, provided it was in the most recent 100 messages in the channel, so you can copy-paste the offending message or a part thereof to generate the snapshot.

Useful for moderators who are about to delete a message but want to record that the message existed, for example in a mods-only channel
